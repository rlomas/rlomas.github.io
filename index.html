		<h2>User Need</h2>
		<p>Many newcomers to Ann Arbor donâ€™t know anyone when they first move. Although they can be good ways to meet people, classes/clubs/work may not always be enough to meet good friends.</p>

	<div class="newSection section">
		<h2>Our System: Linkd</h2>
		<p>Linkd is our solution to the user need. Linkd is a platform for students to meet other students who are interested in the same things as them and in the same classes as them. It can be used to find study groups, find people who do a certain activity, or just to make friends.</p>
